1. Problem Statement:- The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. Explore and analyze the data to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities.

2. Project Summary :- In this EDA project, we were provided with the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) which is a database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017. Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 181,000 cases. In this project we are doing the exploratory data analysis on the global terrorisam database to find out various insights of terrorism activity and their effect over region,country and city. Also we did some visualizations for easy understandings of the analysis. After analyzing the cleaned data, we divided the project into various types of analysis. The first is the analysis based on Trend of Terrorrism Per Year the second is the analysis based on Most affected areas of Terrorism. Third analysis based on Terrorist Organization and the last analysis is based on country. In the EDA we have conclude that after 2011 there is a large growth recorded in terrorist activity and 2014 appears to be a witness of huge terrorist attack.

3. Characteristics of GTD Dataset: Contains information about 1,80,000 terrorist attacks. It is currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world Efficiently covering attacks between 1970 to 2017.

4. Project Goals :-

* Study the source and do some quick research to understand more about the dataset and its topic
  
* Clean the data

* Prepare the data for processing and analysis
  
* Perform data pre-processing to manipulate the data for analysis and draft out targetted tabels for analysis
  
* Analyze the data more deeply and extract insights
  
* Visualize the data using Python 

5. Approach/Steps involved:-

* Loading the dataset

* Null values Treatment

* Exploratory Data Analysis

* Data Visualization

6. Conclusion:-

1) It is clear that there is increase in numbers of terrorist attacks from 2002-2004. Most of the attacks were done on year 2014 and Iraq is the most affected country from terrorism because most of the peoples killed in iraq. In Iraq maximum of 1570 peoples killed in single attack. As expected Baghdad is most affected city(and yes this is also called province).

2) Among all the regions "Middle East & North Africa" has the most number of killed people approx 1.4 Lakhs followed by "South-Asia" & "Sub-saharan Africa

3) "Taliban" is the most powerful, dangerous and the most active gang among all of the gangs, followed by "islamic state of iraq and the levant(isil)" and "shining path(SL)".

4) The most targetted attacks are on "Private Citizens & Property" which is approximately 40% and 10-20% is the target on "Military", "Police", "Government", "Business".

5) It's visible that explosives were used in around 51.09% of the attacks, followed by Firearms accounted for 32.35% of the attacks
